# eloquent3e

Problem attempts from Eloquent Javascript 3e.

## Setup

* I use [webstorm]() for coding.

* This project uses the [jest]() testing framework (for me to learn jest).

* To connect webstorm to jest, [these directions](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2018/10/testing-with-jest-in-webstorm/) are helpful. 
Perhaps Intellij could polish their products a little more, but then again I don't have to purchase them.



## TODO

* Add config

* Convert this larger repo into a smaller set and then use gitree to combine them? Seems like a lot of work for no benefit other than learning gitree.
